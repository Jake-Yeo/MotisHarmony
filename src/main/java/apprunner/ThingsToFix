Handle exceptions causes when account has not yet downloaded a song and user attempts to download song.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyvhvlYvRnc skips past all the identifiers when in playlist

There's a bug where the app cannot deserialize an account.

Sometimes, youtube playlists such as this one https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLleY9vT8KgEjp4k7I4Uv-H7dMEX_eObND may have duplicate videos in them. The duplicated videos are then added to the downloaded queue which may mess up the music player. Fix the program to remove these duplicate videos.

Fix this line if (!youtubeUrlDownloadQueueList.contains(youtubeUrl)) { so that videos already in the download queue are not added again, and so that videos already downloaded are not added again

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1hNOd12yJs The title is not displayed properly since it is in a foreign language.

Instead of just parsing the youtube urls from the playlists. Parse out the youtube titles, channel name, video length and image urls with  the following identifier PanelVideoRenderer":{"title"

Instead of just having an errorListView have an observable errorList in the model so that the controller can listen to list changes and update the errorListView accordingly.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHc3cXXIydc&list=RDCLAK5uy_kb7EBi6y3GrtJri4_ZH56Ms786DFEimbM&start_radio=1 link creates an error when inputted into the download playlist or video url

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibXkjB67cyE This link has no mime=audio and causes an infinite while loop, either find a way to download, or make sure to add to the download error section. Try fixing problem by getting mp4 file from the network tab in the media section.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7814WeR0Xzo This link has no mime=audio and causes an infinite while loop

Ads can still be accidentally downloaded. Fix that problem. 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLleY9vT8KgEjaoNn9HwNceQ28i90HsqZE playlist may lead to infinite loop due to the video titled "MOSHi - dead feelings". Problem: Sometime the link parsed from the youtube url will only contain text. This text when copied and pasted into the browser may lead to the actual audio which can be downloaded.

I put the ObservableList listener in the initializer for DownloadPageViewController. Since it can be intitallized more than once, everytime we switch to the DownloadPage a new listener will be created. Make it so that only one listener is created per launch
