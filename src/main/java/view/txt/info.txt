What is MotisHarmony?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
MotisHarmony is a program which I made for my grade 12 highschool capstone. This program provides a clean intuitive UI for an adequate user experience. 

Unlike other technologies such as online youtube downloaders, my program is able to bypass youtubes download throttling and cipher signatures. Since I use a headless driver to obtain the audio source from the youtube link.

Now you might be wondering, why not just use one of the many other youtube downloaders on github such as youtube-dl? Well it's because these programs instead obtain the audio source from a youtube link by obtaining its cipher signature and then decoding it. To do that, they must first  obtain a .js script from the webpage which decodes this signature cipher.  What makes this method much harder to do is the fact that Youtube knows what people are trying to do. So what Youtube does to try to hide this .js script is by giving the script and variables within that script abstract names making it much harder for coders to parse the information from that .js file. In addition, Youtube also updates its website constantly, changing and implementing the way Youtube works so that it's harder for people to decipher signature ciphers. What ends up happening is a cat and mouse game where Youtube updates its webpage to make it harder for programmers to find and acess its .js scripts which decodes their cipher signatures. This results in continous updates from Youtube-dl.

Because my program instead gets the audio source from Youtube videos using Chrome rather than through Youtube we are able to bypass all of Youtubes methods to prevent users from downloading Youtube videos. In return, I was able to create a Youtube downloader which requires less maintnece and updates than a program such as Youtube-dl.

What problem am I trying to solve with my program?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Like iron rods built into a concrete floor, so too is music the support for our cultures,
relationships and core identities. It‚Äôs what allows us to experience and express our
emotions. That‚Äôs why companies such as Google provide us with services such as
Spotify and Youtube, to allow us easy access to music which is woven into our daily
lives. However, when I use these services, I find that the music I want to listen to isn't
available on Spotify, and the music player on YouTube is designed to pause the video
after a specific period of time to persuade the user to upgrade to a premium version of
Youtube. As a result, I began using alternative services like Bolt and Documents by
Readdle. Unfortunately, more issues occurred; downloading and finding songs saved in
my YouTube playlists was difficult and time-consuming. And with Bolt, there was an
inability to create playlists without duplicating music files which took up unnecessary
space on the device you were using.
