What is MotisHarmony?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
MotisHarmony is a program which I made for my grade 12 highschool capstone. This program provides a clean intuitive UI for an adequate user experience. 

Unlike other technologies such as online youtube downloaders, my program is able to bypass youtubes download throttling and cipher signatures. Since I use a headless driver to obtain the audio source from the youtube link.

Now you might be wondering, why not just use one of the many other youtube downloaders on github such as youtube-dl? Well it's because these programs instead obtain the audio source from a youtube link by obtaining its cipher signature and then decoding it. To do that, they must obtain a .js script from the webpage which they must then interpret to decode this cipher signature. What makes this method much harder is that Youtube knows that people are figuring out ways to download youtube audio and is trying to make it more difficult for such downloads to occur. What ends up happening is a cat and mouse game where Youtube updates its webpage to make it harder for programmers to find and acess its .js scripts which decodes their cipher signatures. This results in continous updates from youtube-dl.

not done plz update and make grammar better
